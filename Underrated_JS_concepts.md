## **Explanation of reduce() in JavaScript**

`reduce()` is a higher-order function in JavaScript that is used to reduce an array to a single value. It takes a callback function as its argument that is applied to each element of the array to accumulate a single value. 

## **Example usage of reduce()**

Here's an example of how `reduce()` can be used to calculate the sum of an array of numbers:

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

const sum = numbers.reduce((accumulator, currentValue) => {
  return accumulator + currentValue;
}, 0);

console.log(sum); // Output: 15
```
